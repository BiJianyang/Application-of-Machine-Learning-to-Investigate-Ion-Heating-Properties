# Application-of-Machine-Learning-to-Investigate-Ion-Heating-Properties
We found that Ar ions were heated to significantly higher temperatures than H ions, and asymmetric heating was observed in Ar plasmas. By applying machine learning, the accuracy of Gaussian fitting was improved by 23%, and the reconstruction precision of ion temperature was enhanced by 10%.
